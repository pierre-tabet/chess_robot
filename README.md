# chess_playing_robot
I designed and manufactured a chess playing robot. I wrote a computer vision program in MATLAB converting a video feed into chess algebraic notation. This was then fed into a chess engine, and the outputs were used with precalculated inverse kinematics in order to move the chess pieces. The hardware and software were designed from first principles.
